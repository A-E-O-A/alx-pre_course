# alx-pre_course
Starting SE course with ALX (My first repo on GitHub)
I'm a complete beginner in Software Engineering (SE). I hope to use this opportunity to boost my career prospects in the space of clean energy.

My favourite things to do are to read crime thrillers, books that center on Africa and African landscape.
I am trying to pick up drawing again and hope to someday have a digital animation preferably telling stories from around the world.
